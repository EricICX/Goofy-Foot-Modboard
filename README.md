# Goofy Foot Modboard

A NES controller PCB design with support for Goofy Foot and normal bindings.

Initially created by me after I found out that my best controller PCB was one from a third party controller that used HASL for the contacts, rather than carbon ink like the originals.

Fun fact: this design has zero vias!

## What's Included

This repository includes [the necessary gerber files to fabricate this PCB yourself](https://github.com/EricICX/Goofy-Foot-Modboard/raw/main/gerbers-v1.1.zip), along with the necessary files to edit this design in KiCAD.
